# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION:

### ABOUT TEXT SUMMARIZATION:

Text summarization is the concept of employing a machine to condense a document or a set of documents into brief paragraphs or statements using mathematical methods. NLP broadly classifies text summarization into 2 groups:

1] Extractive text summarization: here, the model summarizes long documents and represents them in smaller simpler sentences. 

2] Abstractive text summarization: the model has to produce a summary based on a topic without prior content provided.
